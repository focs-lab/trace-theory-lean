/-- Main component of Theorem 4.1 (ii) => (iii).

  For a rational expression X, if every iterative factor of L(X) is connected,
  then X' is star-connected (for some rational expression X' with L(X) = L(X')).

  It is strictly necessary that we use an X' not necessarily equal to X.
  Consider X = {a ∪ b}∗ · ∅; where `a` and `b` are not connected. Then L(X) = ∅ so every
  iterative factor is connected, but X is not star-connected.

  Note that P · ∅ or ∅ · P are the only cases where this patch is needed.
